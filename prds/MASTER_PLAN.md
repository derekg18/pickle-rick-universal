# MASTER_PLAN — Pickle Rick Engineering Lifecycle

**Last updated**: 2026-04-30 PM (Citadel + Hardening Bundle phase 1 SHIPPED; F6 deploy-reversion cure released as v1.62.0)

## 🔔 NEXT PRIORITY WORK

**`prds/anatomy-park-finalizer-history-crash.md`** — pipeline-blocking. `microverse-runner.js:writeFinalReport` derefs `mvState.convergence.history` unconditionally; worker-managed convergence (anatomy-park, szechuan-sauce) doesn't populate that shape, so any successful convergence crashes the finalizer, and `markMicroverseFatalError` overwrites the success marker. Three sibling call sites need the same audit. 8 ACs, 6 forward fixes. Was previously stacked behind `schema-version-deploy-reversion-rca` but that's now shipped (v1.62.0), so this is unblocked.

**Status**: Citadel + Hardening Bundle phase 1 (pickle, codex backend) SHIPPED 2026-04-30 PM — **75/75 tickets Done** in 424m. Phases 2–3 (anatomy-park, szechuan-sauce) skipped on a stale `pipeline-cancel` marker left by an earlier SIGHUP'd run; tracked separately as a pipeline-runner cleanup bug. F6 deploy-reversion cure SHIPPED as `v1.62.0` — release published, install.sh deployed (schemaVersion=3, parity assertion live, kill-switch on performUpgrade). Soak observation (AC-RVN-11) and self-propagation negative test (AC-RVN-12) pending. Predecessor: god-fn epic SHIPPED end-to-end on codex (T0–T19) + anatomy-park overnight (59 trap-door fixes). Other queued PRDs: `god-functions-remediation-phase-2`, `large-tier-stall-recovery`, `deepseek-integration`.

## 1. PRDs

| Path | Status | SHA |
|---|---|---|
| `prds/god-functions-remediation.md` | **Shipped** (2026-04-29) — T0–T19 all Done (16 implementation + 4 hardening) on codex; 27 ESLint-ratchet carve-outs queued for phase 2. | `1658d81` (refined PRD); ESLint closer `7bf3263` |
| (Original, pre-refinement)            | Committed earlier in the day        | `b535e71` |
| `prds/codex-classifier-prompt-leak.md` | **Shipped** (2026-04-26) | `a48097b`, `3bc9bd2`, `a90ed73`, `4b1f784`, `17f6b03` |
| `prds/convergence-toolchain-gates.md` | **Shipped v1.58.0** (2026-04-28) — full 3-phase pipeline: 25 atomic tickets (gate primitive + finalize-gate orchestrator + remediator brief-prep + skill prompt updates + LOA-618 fixture) → anatomy-park surfaced 78 cross-cutting bugs, all fixed (incl. metrics worktree/nested-repo, runner ownership pid stamps, orphan-tmp recovery, hook fallback routing) → szechuan-sauce decomposed god-fns. Phase 1 ran on claude (rate-limited at 5h), phases 2/3 ran on codex (5–10× faster). 122 commits, +19,597/-1,921 LOC. iteration_regressions counter held at 0 throughout — gate didn't false-flag itself. | tag `v1.58.0` |
| **`prds/citadel-hardening-bundle.md`** (active orchestration) | **Queued** (2026-04-29) — `/pickle-pipeline --backend codex` over `prds/citadel.md` + `prds/anatomy-park-followups.md` + `prds/watcher-pane-recovery.md`. Manifest PRD; refiner produces one combined deduped ticket queue (~57 tickets). Sequencing: anatomy-park-followups T3 (microverse codex-relaunch) first (gates citadel's audit-subskill spawn), watcher-pane-recovery second (observability for the run), other followups parallelizable, citadel last. Source PRDs stay independently shippable. | uncommitted (this branch) |
| `prds/large-tier-stall-recovery.md` | Draft (2026-04-27) — 3 atomic tickets (tier-aware circuit-breaker budget, worker resume detection, e2e verification). Targets god-fn T1 codex stall. **NOT started.** Planned v1.57.0 release tag was claimed by cronenberg — retarget to v1.58.0 when picked up. | uncommitted |
| `prds/deepseek-integration.md` | Draft (2026-04-27) — third backend `'deepseek'` riding `claude` CLI via DeepSeek's Anthropic-compat shim; honest identity in state/logs/metrics; ~230 LOC. **NOT started.** | uncommitted |
| `prds/citadel.md` | Draft (2026-04-27, BMAD-merged 2026-04-29) — new `/citadel` command (post-implementation conformance audit: PRD ↔ implementation invariants, AC coverage, sibling guard parity, rule-set invariants, trap-door enforcement) **plus** matched cross-skill updates to `/pickle-refine-prd`, anatomy-park, szechuan-sauce, and cronenberg. Driven by LOA-618 post-mortem. **Absorbed `bmad-inspired-hardening.md`** on 2026-04-29: conformance overlap folded into core (new T17 + AC-CIT-18); remaining BMAD capabilities (`/pickle-readiness`, `/pickle-archaeology`, phase-specialized Morty subagents, `/pickle-correct-course`, `/pickle-debate`, schema migration v2→v3, codex-format pin, hang guards, full risk register R5/R9/R12/R13/R16/R20–R33) preserved verbatim in Appendix. 18 ACs (`AC-CIT-01..18`) + 16 core tasks (T0–T16) + 4 cross-skill (T20–T23) + cronenberg (T13.5) + ~28 BMAD-T## appendix tasks. **NOT started.** | uncommitted (citadel + 3 PRDs landed earlier) |
| `prds/god-functions-remediation-phase-2.md` | Draft (2026-04-28) — follow-up epic for the 27 pre-existing god-functions across 24 files exposed by T14's ESLint ratchet (Phase 1 closer). Each function has a scoped `// eslint-disable-next-line` carve-out from commit `7bf3263`; this epic refactors them and removes the carve-outs. Worst offender: `runGate` in `convergence-gate.ts` (cyclomatic 65, 305 lines). 6 ACs, ~20 atomic tickets sketched. **NOT started.** | committed in this branch |
| `prds/watcher-pane-recovery.md` | Draft (2026-04-28) — single-fix PRD for monitor-window watcher panes that exit on `state.active: false` and don't respawn when mux-runner relaunch brings the session back live. Discovered during the god-fn epic codex run; only `monitor.js` (dashboard) survived a relaunch, the other three watcher panes stayed at `zsh` prompts. 7 ACs, 4 atomic tickets. **NOT started.** | committed in this branch |
| `prds/anatomy-park-followups.md` | Draft (2026-04-29) — 3 small follow-ups identified by the 5-agent review of the 59-commit anatomy-park overnight run: (T1) trap-door catalog hygiene — split 3 oversized entries (pickle-utils.ts at 4042 chars), standardize ENFORCE clauses to test filenames; (T2) `recoverable-json.test.js` — add dedicated unit tests for the extracted module (currently only via state-manager + caller tests); (T3) extend codex-manager relaunch (`bf4a002`) to `microverse-runner.ts` — anatomy-park hit the same 4h subprocess-error wall that mux-runner now handles. 12 ACs, 3 atomic tickets. **NOT started.** | committed in this branch |
| `prds/openrouter-multi-provider-workers.md` | Draft (2026-04-01) — third-party LLM routing for worker spawn via OpenRouter. **NOT started.** No source impl. Lower priority than current bundle. | committed earlier (`e9e9666`) |
| `prds/tool-error-retry-tracking.md` | Draft (2026-03-31) — intra-session tool-failure tracking with escalating pivot guidance, inspired by OMC Ralph mode. **NOT started.** No source impl. Lower priority than current bundle. | committed earlier (`e9e9666`) |
| `prds/smart-iteration-handoff.md` | Refined draft — reduce wasted iterations 30%+ in microverse / 20%+ in tmux via smarter handoff intelligence. **NOT started.** No source impl. Lower priority than current bundle. | committed earlier (`e9e9666`) |
| Cronenberg meta-router skill | **Shipped v1.57.0** (2026-04-27) — explicit-invocation `/cronenberg` skill with deterministic decision matrix + tmux-detach-safe followup chaining. No PRD; designed inline. | `711f92c` |
| `prds/state-schema-version-ordering-incident.md` | **Hot-fix deployed** (2026-04-29 PM) — incident PRD: Citadel + Hardening Bundle pipeline ran C-T0 (schema migration, `order: 200`) before NEW-T2 (v2→v3 rollback safety net, `order: 300`). C-T0 stamped `state.json.schema_version: 3` while deployed `StateManager` capped at v2 → every read threw `SCHEMA_MISMATCH`, monitor and all 4 watcher panes wedged. Hot-patched deployed `STATE_MANAGER_DEFAULTS.schemaVersion: 2 → 3`, force-killed wedged `monitor.js`, relaunched watchers. **Recurring**: deployed file reverts to v2 every ~hour because cross-skill workers (T20–T23) per citadel PRD instruction run `bash install.sh` mid-run, and rsync's atomic-write replaces the inode (chflags uchg lock survives 0 cycles). Watchdog auto-fixes each tick. 8 ACs (AC-SSV-01..08) — first 3 verified, F1–F5 forward fixes pending. | committed `5cacfea` |
| `prds/large-pipeline-time-budget-undersized.md` | **Bug PRD** (2026-04-30) — surfaced live during `pipeline-1204204c` run. Two bugs: (B1) `default_max_time_minutes: 720` is undersized for any pipeline above ~25 tickets — current 75-ticket bundle observes 3.34 tickets/hour on codex, needs ~22.5h for phase 1 alone; (B2) `max_time_minutes` enforcement is leaky — pipeline at 881m elapsed against 720m wall, still shipping tickets. Causes: (B1) launch path doesn't read `decomposition_manifest.json` ticket count + apply throughput-baseline formula; (B2) cap-check fires per-iteration but codex-manager-relaunch resets the "past cap" state, plus schema-mismatch exceptions silently swallow cap-check reads, plus reconstructed `start_time_epoch` carries original launch timestamp instead of resetting. 8 ACs (AC-LPB-01..08), 5 forward fixes (F1 manifest-aware default, F2 hard cap-gate in relaunch, F3 epoch reset on reconstruction, F4 monitor "EXCEEDED" indicator, F5 pickle-pipeline.md Step 0.5 sizing prompt). | committed `ebdcf81` |
| `prds/schema-version-deploy-reversion-rca.md` | **Shipped v1.62.0** (2026-04-30 PM) — F1+F2+F3+F4 in HEAD plus the version bump break the propagating-revert loop because `gh release latest` no longer returns the v1.60.1 tarball. F7 lockdown skipped — F6 went straight in. Deploy verified: schemaVersion=3, `assertSchemaVersionDeployParity` live, `performUpgrade` kill-switch armed. AC-RVN-09 ✅, AC-RVN-10 skipped, AC-RVN-11/12 pending 24h soak. | committed `a11dc6d`, released `v1.62.0` |
| **`prds/anatomy-park-finalizer-history-crash.md`** ⭐ **NEXT PRIORITY WORK** | **Bug PRD** (2026-04-30) — surfaced live during `pipeline-a5e02f01` over `loanlight-api-income-agent-ux` income-agent UX fixes (13/13 pickle tickets shipped; phase 2 anatomy-park converged with 0 confident findings on 2 iterations). **Successful worker-managed convergence followed by FATAL `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'history')` in `microverse-runner.js:writeFinalReport`.** The finalizer reads `mvState.convergence.history` unconditionally; worker-managed convergence (anatomy-park, szechuan-sauce) doesn't populate that shape (`init-microverse.js --convergence-mode worker`). The throw triggers `markMicroverseFatalError` which **overwrites the just-written success marker** in `microverse.json` (`exit_reason: 'converged'` → `'error'`); only `anatomy-park.json` retains the truth. `pipeline-runner` sees exit 1, aborts subsequent phases. Three other call sites in microverse-runner.js (lines 571 buildMicroverseHandoff, 598 getBestScore, 874 last-accepted lookup) need the same audit. 8 ACs (AC-APH-01..08), 6 forward fixes (F1 defensive `?? []` guards in writeFinalReport, F2 same in buildMicroverseHandoff, F3 getBestScore returns null for worker mode, F4 audit + guard last-accepted, F5 markMicroverseFatalError preserves successful exit_reason + writes sibling `microverse-finalizer-error.json`, F6 long-term `convergence_mode` discriminated union on MicroverseSessionState). Operator workaround: trim `pipeline.json` `phases` to drop the completed phase, re-run `pipeline-runner` against same session. **Unblocked** — `schema-version-deploy-reversion-rca` shipped, no more hot-fix reverts. | committed `a11dc6d` |
The refined PRD includes: corrected line ranges, T0 prelude + T14 closer, goal-level 200 LOC carve-outs, 8-token enumeration, T1 post-pass invariants, T7 dry-run replacement (test seam, NO `--dry-run`), T2 scope clarification (`runIteration` already extracted), per-ticket frontmatter, fixture lockdown protocol, helper-signature spec rule, trap-door preservation, and a 17-row Risks table.

Pre-refinement preserved at `~/.local/share/pickle-rick/sessions/2026-04-25-9152e64b/prd.md`.

## 2. Today's session — 2026-04-26 / 2026-04-27

T0 completed cleanly after a marathon debug session that surfaced and fixed five distinct PRC infrastructure bugs. The release line below is the actual deliverable from this session, alongside T0.

### Releases shipped this session

| Version | Bug fixed |
|---|---|
| `v1.56.0` | Pickle phase didn't pin `command_template`; stale `anatomy-park.md` misrouted resumed workers. Added phase-entry helper `enterPicklePhase()` that pins template + scrubs foreign-phase JSON files. Also added `ignore_dirty_paths` (default `prds/`, `docs/`) to clean-tree check. Microverse pre-flight applies same exclusion + auto-commit stages untracked files. Master plan moved to `prds/MASTER_PLAN.md`. |
| `v1.56.1` | Worker prompt "Write ONLY to `${TICKET_DIR}`" — codex took literally and refused all repo writes. Disambiguated to name ticket-artifact files explicitly and authorize Steps 5/8 to write to project working tree. |
| `v1.56.2` | 38 timing-sensitive tests bumped 3–5x to survive load when codex runs concurrent tool calls during baseline capture. Verified under 2x concurrent runs. |
| `v1.56.3` | Morty workers leaked orchestrator promise tokens upstream. Added `FORBIDDEN_WORKER_TOKENS` + runtime scrub in `spawn-morty.ts` finalize-time, plus prompt-level forbidden list. |
| `v1.56.4` | **Manager itself misuses EPIC_COMPLETED** — conflates per-ticket completion with epic completion. Replaced fail-loud guard with `evaluateEpicCompletion()` recovery state machine: 4-arm decision (genuine / recover_advance / recover_retry / persistent_hallucination). Pipeline survives manager hallucination structurally. Counter persists in `state.false_epic_completed_count`. **This is the fix that finally let T0 complete.** |
| `v1.57.0` | **Cronenberg meta-router shipped** (post-stash, 2026-04-27). New `/cronenberg` skill — explicit-invocation deterministic router that picks the right pickle metaphor + cleanup chain for a build/implement request. Tmux-detach-safe, flag pass-through, persona footprint = one Dispatch line. Unrelated to the god-fn epic; shipped as a side-quest. |
| `v1.58.0` | **Convergence-toolchain-gates shipped** (2026-04-28). New `convergence-gate` primitive (`runGate({mode,scope,checks,allowedPaths})`) + `finalize-gate.ts` post-runner orchestrator + `morty-gate-remediator` agent (mechanical-only autofix worker with snapshot-and-revert protocol) + `check-gate.ts`/`spawn-gate-remediator.ts` CLIs. Wires into `/szechuan-sauce` (line-205 tmux chain) and `/anatomy-park` (Step 6.6 baseline + line-166 chain). 14 new activity events, `iteration_regressions` counter on `MicroverseSessionState`, `gate-commands.json` for pnpm/npm/yarn/cargo/go, baseline schema with `(file, ruleOrCode, occurrence_index)` fingerprint, freshness invariants, R17 OOS handling, R18 dirty-worktree skip, R19 baseline-stale halt, R20 bootstrap recursion (gate-the-gate). Anatomy-park run on this PR exercised the gate against itself and found 78 cross-cutting bugs (CRITICAL/HIGH) across pickle-rick — all fixed in-loop. LOA-618 fixture replay test pinned. Final fixes pre-release: metrics-utils `git log --since` semantic bug (date-only boundary) + worktree commit attribution + 2 P1 findings in convergence-gate.ts (unsafe `as string` cast on empty cmd, silent error swallow on race). |

### T0 deliverables landed

- `extension/REFACTOR_BASELINE.md` — captured `npm test`/`tsc`/`eslint` baseline at HEAD `c205292`
- `extension/REFACTOR_FEASIBILITY.md` — feasibility proof for `_emitDot`/`mux-runner main` extractions, all helpers under cyclomatic-15 ceiling
- `extension/eslint.config.js` — added warn-level `complexity` (15) and `max-lines-per-function` (120) rules + per-file 200-LOC carve-outs for `dot-builder.ts` and `microverse-runner.ts`
- `extension/scripts/smoke-deployed-hooks.sh` — exec'able, exits 0 against deployed stop-hook (verified)
- `extension/tests/fixtures/dot-builder/` — 8 golden DOT fixtures (catastrophic-recovery, competing, convergence, fan-out, isolated-workspace-convergence, microverse, review-ratchet, sequential)
- `extension/tests/fixtures/{microverse,mux-runner,setup,spawn-morty,stop-hook}/` — token, schema, version, mutation fixtures
- T0 frontmatter `status: "Done"`

### What ate the day (so the next session has the receipts)

- v1.56.0 was the structural unblocker — without it, every resume picked up an `anatomy-park.md` template and the codex worker dutifully ran the wrong skill.
- v1.56.1 — codex is a literalist. Any prompt rule with "ONLY" or "NEVER" is read absolutely, even when context makes the intended scope obvious. Future prompt edits in this codebase: enumerate scopes explicitly; never use "ONLY" as a hard constraint.
- v1.56.4 worked exactly as designed: the v1.56.4 run logged **18 `MANAGER_FALSE_EPIC_COMPLETED` markers** during T0 alone. Every one of those was a hallucinated epic completion that would have killed the pipeline pre-fix. Recovery state machine caught all 18.

### Why the run still stopped

After T0 landed and codex advanced to T1 (`f068af3f` — Split `_emitDot`, the largest god function), codex ran for 5 iterations doing research/plan analysis without making implementation commits. Mux-runner's circuit breaker (separate from the EPIC_COMPLETED recovery — this one watches actual progress like ticket-status changes and commits) tripped at iteration 8 and exited. **This is not a hallucination — it's that T1's complexity (905 LOC, 6 helpers, 8 new tests) exceeded codex's per-iteration thinking budget.**

T1 status reset to `Todo` so resume starts fresh.

---

## 2.1 Today's session — 2026-04-28 / 2026-04-29 (god-fn epic SHIPPED on codex)

**Headline**: the god-function refactor epic that previously stalled at T1 with zero edits ran end-to-end on codex backend. T0–T19 (16 implementation + 4 hardening) all landed, then anatomy-park bonus phase added 59 trap-door fixes overnight. **~87 commits, ~10,500 LOC of refactor diff, 0 manual interventions.** The day's work is the validation that codex backend is now production-grade for large refactor epics.

### Releases shipped this session

| Version | What |
|---|---|
| `v1.59.0` | **Codex stall hardening** — P0 contract addendum (commit-required + DEFERRED-on-AC-contradiction + no-harness-exploration), commit-pending probe (handoff.txt nudge on stagnation), per-backend iteration budget (`claude:100, codex:80`), post-flush guard (no false-fail on short post-promise log when commits exist), per-ticket routing heuristic (default off). Plus `--effort low|medium|high` flag plumbing through codex CLI as `-c reasoning.effort=<level>`. |
| `v1.59.1` | **Codex isolation from `~/.codex/` rule files** — `--ignore-rules --ignore-user-config` added to `buildCodexInvocation`. Bypassing the parallel-universe `~/.codex/skills/pickle*` registry that was misdirecting codex mid-iteration with stale paths. The unblocker for the god-fn epic resume. |

### What landed (commit clusters)

| Cluster | Commits | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Codex stall hardening (v1.59.x) | 8 | session work — P0/P1/P2 fixes from RCA |
| Phase 1 god-fn epic (T0–T15) on codex | 18 | codex backend, autonomous |
| Phase 1 hardening + audit (T16–T19) | 6 | codex backend, autonomous |
| Anatomy-park bonus overnight | 59 | codex backend, autonomous (12h run) |
| Lint carve-outs + cleanup | 3 | session work — eslint ratchet exposure handling |
| PRD docs (this update + 3 follow-ups) | 2 | session work |
| **Total** | **~96** | |

### Codex backend validation — pre vs post v1.59.x

| Metric | Pre-v1.59.x (this same session resumed) | Post-v1.59.1 |
|---|---|---|
| T1 outcome | Stalled at iter 5, **zero edits** in 50 min | Done in 14 min, 463 LOC + 116 LOC tests |
| Tickets shipped autonomously | 0 (T0 was already pre-existing) | 19 (T0–T19) |
| Manual interventions during run | constant | zero |
| Wall time for full implementation phase | n/a (never finished) | 3h 41m |
| Self-correction commits | 0 | 2 (T3 complexity cleanup, T5 state-ownership fix) |

### Failure modes surfaced + addressed

| FM | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| FM-1 stall-on-judgment | codex loops on AC contradiction without descoping | P0 contract addendum (`v1.59.0`) — descope + DEFERRED note |
| FM-2 stall-on-abstraction | codex explores harness internals (setup.js, mux-runner.js) instead of ticket scope | P0 contract addendum + worker prompt rule |
| FM-3 commit-skip | codex produces edits but never commits, work orphaned at breaker trip | P0 contract addendum + post-flush guard |
| FM-4 stall-on-imaginary-worker | codex narrates a non-existent worker subprocess, polling forever | `--ignore-rules --ignore-user-config` (`v1.59.1`) — bypasses stale `~/.codex/skills/pickle*` |
| Codex 4h subprocess wall | codex CLI session ceiling kills long-running manager | `bf4a002` — auto-relaunch ≤5 retries (mux-runner only; microverse-runner still vulnerable, see `prds/anatomy-park-followups.md`) |

### Why the pipeline stopped at Phase 2/3

Pickle-pipeline was running `pickle → anatomy-park → szechuan-sauce`. Phase 1 (pickle) shipped T0–T19 cleanly. Phase 2 (anatomy-park) ran 12h, completed 70 iterations + 59 trap-door fixes, then hit the same 4h codex-subprocess-error wall — but `microverse-runner.ts` (anatomy-park's engine) doesn't have the relaunch fix that `mux-runner.ts` got in `bf4a002`. Pipeline-runner classified the phase as failed and stopped before Phase 3 (szechuan-sauce) started. **This is the C ticket in `prds/anatomy-park-followups.md`.**

### Net status (verified on disk, 2026-04-29)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Working tree | Clean (only 3 pre-existing PRD drafts untracked) |
| `tsc --noEmit` | Clean |
| `eslint src/ --max-warnings=-1` | 0 errors, 19 advisory warnings |
| Test suite | **3076/3076 pass** (+68 tests added by codex during the epic) |
| 5-agent review verdict | HIGH / HIGH / MEDIUM (behavioral parity / extraction / catalog hygiene) |
| Branch | 4 commits ahead of `origin/main` (cleanup), pushed |

### Two behavioral changes worth flagging in next release notes

- **`max_iterations: 0`** now valid in mux-runner (commit `8105845`) — was rejected before, now treated as "unlimited sentinel". Backward-compatible.
- **Fractional numeric CLI flags now error** (commit `aba7369`) — was silent truncation via `parseInt`, now `Number.isInteger` rejects. `--worker-timeout 1.5` → error; users round to `2`.

## 2.2 Today's session — 2026-04-29 PM (Citadel + Hardening Bundle decomposed + LAUNCHED)

**Headline**: refinement of `prds/citadel-hardening-bundle.md` completed (3 cycles × 3 analysts, all_success). Decomposed into **75 tickets** (1 parent + 74 children, orders 5..840). Pipeline launched in tmux session `pipeline-1204204c` on `--backend codex`. NEW-T3 already shipped at `585f71c` (anchor re-grounding); B-T1 (trap-door catalog hygiene) in flight.

### Refinement output

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Cycles requested / completed | 3 / 3 |
| Analyst roles | requirements / codebase / risk-scope |
| `refinement_manifest.json.all_success` | true |
| Refinement artifacts | `<SESSION_ROOT>/refinement/analysis_{requirements,codebase,risk-scope}.md` |
| Refinement summary | `<SESSION_ROOT>/refinement_summary.md` |

### Decisions locked

| Decision | Detail |
|---|---|
| **BMAD scope** | **Option B (in-scope)** — full BMAD-T01..T28 appendix included |
| **Backend** | `codex` for implementation + review (refinement was claude per skill contract) |
| **CAP bump** | `CODEX_MANAGER_RELAUNCH_CAP` raised 5 → 10 (committed `932ac54`); deployed at `~/.claude/pickle-rick/extension/types/index.js:61` |

### Six refinement-derived corrections (folded into ticket queue)

1. **Drop proposed A-T5** — would violate AC-WPR-04's "exactly once" rule. 3 existing `ensureMonitorWindow` call sites (`pipeline-runner.ts:1001`, `mux-runner.ts:1542`, `microverse-runner.ts:1512`) suffice.
2. **AC-WPR-07 mode names** — source PRD says `'refine'`; `MonitorMode` union actually says `'refinement'`. Tickets must use `'refinement'`.
3. **B-T2 must drive only public API** — `parseDeadTmp` / `parseJsonObjectFile` / `listEntries` are module-private. Drive `readRecoverableJsonObject` only.
4. **Sequencing fix** — B-T1 (trap-door cleanup) MUST land before C-T0 (which amends the same trap-door entry). Ordered B-T1=10, C-T0=200.
5. **AC-BUNDLE-03 cap scope** — `codex_manager_relaunch_count` cap is per-state-file, including child `microverse_*/state.json`.
6. **B-T3 ordering** — order=20, gates citadel's audit-subskill spawn.

### Six NEW refinement-derived tickets (NEW-T1..T6)

| ID | Order | Title | Implements |
|---|---|---|---|
| NEW-T3 | 5 | Anchor re-grounding orchestrator step | AC-BUNDLE-15 |
| NEW-T5 | 30 | codex-required frontmatter check in pipeline-runner | AC-BUNDLE-18 |
| NEW-T1 | 250 | citadel-cross-phase-fixture authoring | AC-BUNDLE-02 |
| NEW-T2 | 300 | v2→v3 state migration rollback path | AC-BUNDLE-16 |
| NEW-T4 | 350 | Phase-ordered AC firing enforcement | AC-BUNDLE-15 |
| NEW-T6 | 400 | Linear ticket integration (per-ticket lifecycle) | AC-BUNDLE-19 |

### Five new bundle-level ACs (AC-BUNDLE-15..19)

- **AC-BUNDLE-15** — ACs evaluated in 4 explicit phases (`pre-refinement` / `post-refinement` / `per-phase` / `bundle-end`); `evaluation_phase` field carried per-AC; phase-N failure halts before phase-N+1.
- **AC-BUNDLE-16** — v3-on-v2 incompatibility produces recoverable, operator-actionable error.
- **AC-BUNDLE-17** — no trap-door entry exceeds 1500 chars; every state.json field named in exactly one INVARIANT.
- **AC-BUNDLE-18** — `pipeline-runner` reads bundle PRD frontmatter `backend: codex-required` at startup; non-codex invocation rejected with actionable error.
- **AC-BUNDLE-19** — per-ticket Linear creation/transitions via Linear MCP; bundle-end emits Linear comments linking session log.

### Mid-run incident (2026-04-29 ~17:00 PDT) — schema-version ordering bug

The pipeline blew through faster than expected: 13 tickets shipped in ~2.5h (NEW-T3 → B-T1 → B-T3 → NEW-T5 → A-T1..A-T4 → B-T2 → C-T0..C-T3). C-T0 ("Citadel: Session-state schema migration", order=200) bumped `state.json.schema_version: 1 → 3` per its design — but the deployed `StateManager` still capped at v2 (no `bash install.sh` run yet). Every monitor pane and hook started throwing `SCHEMA_MISMATCH`. The dashboard pane wedged on `Awaiting signal...` and required `kill -9` (the `monitor.js` SIGINT handler couldn't run because the loop was blocked inside `process.stdout.write` against a backpressured pty).

**Root cause** (3 layers): (L1) my decomposition put NEW-T2 ("v2→v3 rollback safety net", order=300) AFTER C-T0 (order=200) — pipeline-runner sorts by numeric order and ignores the `links: depends_on` I expressed; (L2) pipeline-runner has no DAG awareness; (L3) source TS shipped `schemaVersion: 3` but deployed JS was stale until install.sh.

**Hot-fix applied**: bumped `~/.claude/pickle-rick/extension/types/index.js` `STATE_MANAGER_DEFAULTS.schemaVersion: 2 → 3` (now consistent with source TS at `extension/src/types/index.ts:96`). Force-killed wedged `monitor.js` (PID 23280). Relaunched all four watchers via `tmux send-keys`. Pipeline never stopped progressing — recovered observability without losing in-flight work.

**Forward fixes** (F1–F5) tracked in `prds/state-schema-version-ordering-incident.md`: lower NEW-T2's order; teach pipeline-runner to honor `links: depends_on` as a hard sort fence; make `StateManager.read()` emit actionable `bash install.sh` error on schema mismatch; harden `monitor.js` SIGINT against stdout backpressure; add CI parity check for deployed-vs-source schemaVersion.

### Mid-run incident #2 (2026-04-30 ~03:00 UTC onward) — undersized time budget + leaky enforcement

Pipeline crossed the configured `max_time_minutes: 720` wall at iter 25 (~705m elapsed) and kept running. By iter 36 it was at 881 min elapsed (161 min over) and still shipping tickets at 3.34/hour. **Two bugs surfaced** (full PRD: `prds/large-pipeline-time-budget-undersized.md`):

- **B1 (sizing)**: 720m default is undersized for any pipeline above ~25 tickets. Current bundle (75 tickets) needs ~22.5h on codex backend just for phase 1 (`pickle`). Launch path doesn't read `decomposition_manifest.json` ticket count to recommend a budget. User has to guess at launch.
- **B2 (enforcement)**: `max_time_minutes` cap-check exists in mux-runner but is leaky. Codex-manager-relaunch resets the "past cap" state every 4h. Schema-mismatch exceptions during cap-check silently swallow. Reconstructed sessions inherit the original `start_time_epoch` rather than resetting, accumulating elapsed time across crashes.

**Net effect**: Bug 2 is masking Bug 1 — pipeline keeps running past the wall instead of dying. The user gets a complete run, but the safety primitive doesn't work. Forward fixes F1–F5 in the linked PRD: manifest-aware default at launch, hard cap-gate in codex-manager-relaunch, `start_time_epoch` reset on reconstruction, monitor "EXCEEDED" indicator, `pickle-pipeline.md` Step 0.5 sizing prompt.

### Mid-run incident #3 (2026-04-30 ~00:30 UTC onward) — recurring schema-version reversion every ~hour

After the first hot-fix at 23:53 UTC, deployed `STATE_MANAGER_DEFAULTS.schemaVersion` reverted from `3` back to `2` four more times over the next 8 hours, on a roughly hourly cadence. Each reversion wedged fresh-process state reads (existing watchers/hooks held in-memory v3 caches and stayed alive). Watchdog cron `614355bb` auto-fixed each occurrence per its whitelist (c) — bump deployed v2→v3, restart all 4 watchers, log FIXED in `${SESSION}/watchdog.log`.

**Mechanism**: cross-skill workers (T20–T23) explicitly run `bash install.sh` per the citadel PRD §"Cross-skill commit hygiene" instruction. install.sh's rsync uses atomic-write (write-tmp + rename-over), creating a NEW inode for `types/index.js`. The new inode inherits flags from the SOURCE file (none), not from the deletion-replaced destination. **chflags uchg lock survives 0 rsync cycles.** This means defense-in-depth via filesystem flags is theatre; the real fix is making source TS / source compiled JS canonically v3 (already done) AND making install.sh aware of in-flight pipeline schema constraints (F2/F3 in the schema-ordering PRD).

## 3. Current state (verified on disk, 2026-04-30 AM)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| God-fn epic tickets | **T0–T19 all Done** (per §2.1) — 16 implementation + 4 hardening shipped on codex backend |
| **Active pipeline** | **`pipeline-1204204c` (Citadel + Hardening Bundle, 75 tickets, codex backend)** — 1/74 children done so far (NEW-T3 at `585f71c`); B-T1 in flight |
| Working tree | `extension/CLAUDE.md` modified by in-flight B-T1 (trap-door catalog hygiene). Untracked PRD drafts: `deepseek-integration.md`, `large-tier-stall-recovery.md`. |
| Test suite | **3076/3076 pass** at session start (will drift during pipeline run; gate verifies at finalize-time per phase) |
| `eslint src/ --max-warnings=-1` | 0 errors at session start |
| `tsc --noEmit` | clean at session start |
| Latest release (prose) | **v1.59.1** (codex isolation fix) |
| CAP=10 deploy | `extension/src/types/index.ts:160` → 10 (committed `932ac54`, deployed at `~/.claude/pickle-rick/extension/types/index.js:61`). Mitigates RB6 (long-codex-run cap exhaustion). |

## 4. Resume strategy

Original god-fn resume strategies (Options A–D) are obsolete; T0–T19 shipped on codex per §2.1.

For the **active Citadel + Hardening Bundle pipeline**: if `pipeline-1204204c` exits before completion, resume with `node ~/.claude/pickle-rick/extension/bin/pipeline-runner.js $SESSION_ROOT` (the runner is idempotent on `state.step` / `state.current_ticket`). Watcher pane recovery during phase transitions is delivered by Section A tickets (A-T1..A-T4) earlier in the queue.

## 6. Cross-cutting rules (from refined PRD Approach §1–§12)

These apply to every PR in the epic — keep them in mind during code review:

1. **Atomic PRs** — one ticket per PR.
2. **Full gate per PR**: `cd extension && npx tsc --noEmit && npx eslint src/ --max-warnings=-1 && npx tsc && npm test` (plus the 3 hygiene tests fire automatically).
3. **Same-file rebase rule** — T1, T10, T11 all touch `dot-builder.ts` (non-overlapping line ranges; rebase-before-review, not strict numeric order).
4. **Test placement** — unit tests in `extension/tests/`; integration in `extension/tests/integration/`. Both append to `package.json:13`.
5. **`package.json:13` append-at-end protocol** — alphabetize once at T14, never per-PR.
6. **Single version bump at T14** — per-PR commits use `refactor(god-fn):` without bumps. Target version reset (see §5 above).
7. **Fixture lockdown** — refactor PRs cannot modify fixtures inline; mid-epic fixture updates are separate `fixture-update`-labeled PRs.
8. **Helper-signature spec rule** — every helper signature pre-declared in ticket body; discriminated unions over booleans; no mutable-ref side-effects.
9. **Trap-door preservation** — T12 must NOT touch `displayMacNotification` (sibling at `pickle-utils.ts:893+`); T13 helpers stay PRIVATE to `scope-resolver.ts`.
10. **Rollback discipline** — each PR independently revertible.
11. **Reviewer rotation** — single reviewer, ≤24h SLA.
12. **Cohesion > raw line count** — files may grow 5–15% from helper boilerplate; that's fine.

---

## 7. Open questions / pre-implementation gates (resolved)

- **Reviewer assignment** — N/A — codex backend ran autonomously.
- **Branch strategy** — Continued on main per-PR; resolved by execution.
- **Backend choice for T1** — Codex shipped T1 in 14 min (post v1.59.1 fixes).
- **Codex large-tier circuit-breaker tuning** — Pursued separately as `prds/large-tier-stall-recovery.md`.

---

## 8. Bug-class observations (record for future codex prompt design)

Codex backend exhibits a consistent class of failures we hit five times today. Each is now mitigated, but the pattern is worth documenting for future prompt authors:

1. **Codex is a literalist.** Any "ONLY"/"NEVER" rule is read absolutely. Don't write rules whose plain reading contradicts later steps in the same prompt.
2. **Codex bleeds context across nearby instructions.** If `pickle.md` (manager) and `send-to-morty.md` (worker) both define completion tokens and the worker has both in its addDirs, codex can use the wrong one. Mitigation: per-context forbidden lists, runtime token scrubbing (v1.56.3).
3. **Codex confuses scope levels.** Per-ticket completion vs epic completion both look like "I finished" to codex. Mitigation: structural recovery in mux-runner (v1.56.4) — never trust the model's claim of "epic done" without verifying ticket statuses.
4. **Codex stalls on large refactors.** Iteration budgets sized for "implement one helper extraction" don't cover "implement six". Mitigation: tier-aware circuit-breaker budgets (deferred), or hand-do large tickets.
5. **Codex tests are load-fragile.** Wall-clock-bounded tests with `{ timeout: 15_000 }` flake when codex runs them concurrent with its own tool calls. Mitigation: 3–5x budget bumps in v1.56.2.
